## General Design Considerations

* Generally used with limited space and/or a long list of choices
* PhET comboboxes are not auto-select when hovering options with a mouse or when navigating through options with the
  arrow keys (i.e., different from radio button lists)
* Label for control serves a dual purpose: identifies the combobox (list of options) and identifies the selected option
* Selected item is communicated clearly upon focus and when the list is closed
* Large pointer/click areas: box label and selected item; option labels and images

## Aesthetic Considerations

* List can appear above or below the button depending on space considerations
* Can include an indicator image (to the left of the list item)
* The rounded corners of the list should match the rounded corners of the button
* Generally, the list panel is often the same width as the button
* Mouse hover and focus highlights should be considered together

## Accessibility

The PhET combobox interaction, visually looks and behaves as a `combobox` in the sense that a list of hidden options can
be revealed on demand; however, the accessible representation that we have found to work nicely is actually a button,
which may have a dynamic label (i.e., accessible name) that pops up a `listbox` with a list of options. Design and
interaction details are below.

### Gesture Support

### Keyboard Support

| Key             | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enter and Space | If the listbox is NOT displayed, opens/expands the listbox and moves focus to selected option in the opened list. (Note Space key is not specified in the standard, but that's how our example and the W3C example work. Space key works on a button, but not specifically on a list.) |
| Enter           | If the listbox is displayed, selects item and collapses the listbox and moves focus to the button.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Escape          | If the listbox is displayed, collapses the listbox without changing the slection and moves focus to the button.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Down Arrow      | Moves focus to the next option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Up Arrow        | Moves focus to the previous option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Home (Optional) | Moves focus to first option. (Recommended when there are more than 5 items)                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| End (Optional)  | Moves focus to last option. (Recommended when there are more than 5 items)                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Sample HTML for Combobox

The PhET combobox interaction, visually looks and behaves as a combobox; however, the ARIA 1.1 Combobox design pattern
wasn't and will never be supported. For the accessible representation in the Parallel DOM we implemented this widget as
a dynamic `button` and a popped-up `listbox` (Bryan Garanventa, 2016). The HTML example is below.

**Note:** The HTML for this interaction may change when the ARIA role `combobox` has better support accross assitive
technologies.

#### Molarity Example (10 options)

```html
	<div tabindex="-1" id="container-for-labels">
	<span id="listbox-static-label">Solute</span>
	  <button id="listbox-option-dynamic-label" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-labelledby="listbox-static-label listbox-option-dynamic-label">Drink Mix</button>
	</div>
	<ul role="listbox" tabindex="0" id="listbox" aria-activedescendant="option-1" aria-labelledby="listbox-static-label" style="list-style:none;">
	  <li role="option" id="option-1" class="selected" aria-selected="true">Drink mix</li>
	  <li role="option" id="option-2">Cobalt (II) nitrate</li>
	  <li role="option" id="option-3">Cobalt Chloride</li>
	  <li role="option" id="option-4">Potassium dichromate</li>
	  <li role="option" id="option-5">Gold (III) chloride</li>
	  <li role="option" id="option-6">Potassium chromate</li>
	  <li role="option" id="option-7">Nickel (II) chloride</li>
	  <li role="option" id="option-8">Copper sulfate</li>
	  <li role="option" id="option-9">Potassium permanganate</li>
	  <li role="option" id="option-10">Potassium dichromate</li>
	</ul>
	<!-- help text for combobox -->
	<p>Change a solute and observe differences.</p>
```

Accessible Name (dynamic):  Text + {{Name of Selected list item}} (e.g. Solute: {{Drink Mix}})

Interaction Type: Combobox (i.e., `Combobox.ts` composed of subcomponents `ComboBoxButton.ts (tagName: 'button')`
and `ComboBoxListBox.ts (ariaRole: 'listbox')`

Button Label with initial selection:

Listbox list items:

* List Item 1 (e.g., Drink Mix)
* List Item 2 (e.g., Cobalt (II) nitrate)
* List Item 3

(Optional) Help Text:

(Optional) Link to section with object & context responses

(Optional) Design Note: Special things about this combobox, if any.

## General Design Considerations

Hereâ€™s when and why we use accordion boxes:

* Default state can be expanded or collapsed depending on how the designer wants to scaffold the user interaction. A
  closed panel can be used to keep the default opening condition of sim from being visually overwhelming, and suggesting
  a logical route for exploration, for example in Build an Atom and in GE:B (please spell out simulation name).
* Accordion boxes can also be useful for teachers to ask predictive questions.
* Can contain non-interactive readouts, interactive controls, but not sprites (e.g., draggable toolbox items).

**Note this design pattern covers multiple PhET Component Types**

* [AccordionBox.js](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/blob/main/js/AccordionBox.js)
* [ExpandCollapseBar.js](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/blob/main/js/ExpandCollapseBar.js)
* [ExpandCollpaseButton.js](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/blob/main/js/ExpandCollpaseButton.js)

## Aesthetic Considerations

* If space is a concern, the title can be hidden while the accordion box is expanded. Note that an accessible name for
  the title is always needed and available for the non-visual experience.
* An expanded accordion box cannot overlap other elements when opened (unlike combo box, for instance).
* Always includes an iconed button (+/-), typically to the left of the title.
* Other sim content does not fill the space when an accordion box is collapsed.
* The accordion box content can be expanded or collapsed by default and a change of state for one accordion does not
  affect the state of other accordion boxes.

## Accessibility Considerations

### Accessible Components of an Accordion Box

Adapted from: ARIA Pracrices 1.1, [section 3.1 Accordion](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion)

* **Accordion Header**: Label (usually a heading with a +/- icon signalling expand/collapse behaviour) for a section of
  content (usually a collapsible box). The accordion header could also be an icon, alone. The accordion header serves as
  a control that can show or hide a section of content.
* **Accordion Panel**: Section of content (e.g., the content box) associated with an accordion header

* Typically, has a visual title with an icon that indicates expanded and collapsed state.
  * The title may disappear when box is expanded.
  * Focus highlight would go around title in both the expanded and collapsed states, if title remains visible.
  * If title visually disappears when expanded, the focus highlight would be limited to the open/close icon and the
    designer would need to consider extra padding to ensure a reasonable clickable area.
  * It is possible that the focus highlight can change size when toggling between expanded/collapsed states in the
    scenario when the expanded box does not have a title.
* The typical structure is a `button` nested within the parent titling element, likely a heading.
* Typically, the open/close icon does not need to be represented in the Parallel DOM.
* For accessibility the expanded and collapsed states of the box are communicated through a combination of ARIA
  attributes, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-hidden` that have to be managed through javascript.

**QUESTION: It's not clear to me how users get inside a panel, if the panel has no focusable items.**

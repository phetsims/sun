## General Design Considerations

Here’s the when and why we use a checkbox (traditional looking checkbox user interface component) in simulation design.

* Generally, when a secondary or non-essential option needs to be toggled between on and off states
* To toggle more than one option in a group of options
* Checkboxes are often used to allow users to layer on more complex representations, or to view multiple, related
  represenations simultaneously. More complex options are generally off by default.

**Note this design pattern covers multiple PhET Component Types**

* Question: Are there any other types of visual checkboxes?

## Aesthetic Considerations

* Checkbox appears checked or not checked on simulation load
* Appears with a text-based label, or an icon as the label, or a combination of both text and icon
* Title case is used for text-based labels for checkboxes

## Accessibility Considerations

* HTML checkboxes (i.e., `input type="checkbox"`) and possibly all visual PhET sim checkboxes are two-state controls
  that represent the element's "checkedness" state.
* Traditional looking checkboxes with visual labels are generally best represented in the PDOM as an `input` of type
  checkbox with an associated `label` element.
* When the visual label content is an image or a string of text that does immediately translate into a name that clearly
  communicates what the checkbox is for, non-visually, consider changing the visual string, adding clarifying help text,
  or providing a more descriptive name as the `label` element's content in the PDOM. Keep in mind that ideally, the
  visual text and the text in the PDOM should be the same to support users who use voiced commands.
* Groups of related checkboxes may benefit from being explicitly grouped using a containing element (e.g., `fieldset`
  or `div`) with the ARIA `role="group"`. Grouping checkboxes is optional.
* Explicitly grouped checkboxes may benefit from a group name provided by either an `h3` or a `legend`.
* Checkboxes that appear visually grouped (e.g., by proximity or with a visual box) for convenience or space-saving may
  not benefit from explicit group semantics in the PDOM.
* When a group is very important, consider using a heading, e.g., `h3` as headings are placed in the heading outline
  which can be navigated with screen reader software whereas the `legend` element is not placed in the heading
  hierarchy.

**Note:** Known issue that some screen readers (i.e., VoiceOver) repeat the checkbox's label content when the `label` is
associated with the `input` via the `for` attribute. We discovered that we do not get repetition of the label content
when the `label` comes before the checkbox. When there is no visible screen label, the `aria-label` attribute is an
option, and it also does not cause any repetition.

### Gesture Support

ToDO.

### Keyboard Support

| Key   | Function                                               |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| Tab   | Moves keyboard focus to the checkbox.                  |
| Space | Toggles checkbox between checked and unchecked states. |

### Management of Role, Property, State, and Tabindex Attributes

Respecting the first rule of ARIA, "use a native HTML element whenever possible", we use native checkbox elements in the
PDOM to represent traditional looking checkbox interactions. An HTML checkbox could represent other "switching"
interactions that may not visaully look like a checkbox in the simulation, but examples for those are provided
elsewhere. Because we use native HTML for checkbox interactions, some of the guidance provided in ARIA Practices for
checkbox widgets is not relevant. I have adapted the content from the ARIA practices section for checkbox.

- No explicit ARIA role of checkbox is needed on an native HTML checkbox (`input type="checkbox"`).
- No `tabindex` required, native HTML checkboxes are focusable elements.
- An HTML checkbox has an accessible label (i.e., accessible name) provided by one of two of the following ways:
  - Visible text content contained within a `label` element and assocaited to its `input` with the `for` attribute.
  - Content within an `aria-label` attribute set on the `input` element with `type="checkbox"`.
- When checked, the checkbox element has the attribute `checked` present.
- When not checked, the `checked` attribute is not present.
- When partially checked, it has state `aria-checked` set to `mixed`. *(tri-state checkboxes only)*
- When a set of checkboxes is presented as a logical group with a visible label, the checkboxes are included in an
  element with `role="group"` that has the property `aria-labelledby` set to the ID of the element containing the label
  or name for the group.
- When the presentation includes additional descriptive static text (i.e., help text) relevant to a checkbox or group of
  checkboxes, using `aria-describedby` is an option to provide automatically read help text. We have, however, that
  automatic helptext is not needed in our sims. Users seem to prefer on-demand help text.

### Simplified HTML Examples for PDOM

#### Options for Checkbox in the A11y API

When creating the common code component, it would be useful to have options to use either a `label` element or
an `aria-label` attribute to provide the accessible name for the checkbox.

#### Checkbox with visual label text

##### Energy Forms and Changes

Visual checkbox with a text-based label:
![alt text "Sample unchecked checkbox for Engery Symbols"](images/efac-checkbox-energy-symbols.png "Energy Symbols, checkbox checked")

###### State Descriptions

```html
<input id=”energy-symbols” type=”checkbox”> <!-- not checked checkbox-->
<label for=”energy-symbols”>Energy Symbols</label>
<p>Observe energy chunks move and change through system.</p>
```

###### Responsive Descriptions

* When checked: Symbols flow with energies.
* When unchecked: Energy symbols hidden.

#### Checkbox without visual label text (option with aria-label)

##### Area Model Introduction

Visual checkbox with different label
![alt text "Sample check"](images/ami-checkbox-123.png "Numeric Checkbox")

```html
<input id="counting-numbers" type="checkbox" aria-label="Counting numbers">
<p>Use area grid with or without counting numbers in grid cells.</p>
```

#### Unnamed group of checkboxes

##### Gravity Force Lab

**Note: still need to finish this example.**

```html
<input id=”” type=”checkbox”> <!-- not checked checkbox-->
<label for=””>Constant Size</label>
<p>When changing mass, observe constant or changing size of spheres.</p>

<input id=”” type=”checkbox”> <!-- not checked checkbox-->
<label for=””>Force Values</label>
<p>Explore value of forces in newtons.</p>

<input id=”” type=”checkbox”> <!-- not checked checkbox-->
<label for=””>Scientific Notation</label>
<p>Listen to newtons in scientific notation.</p>
```
